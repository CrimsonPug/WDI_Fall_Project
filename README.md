Working Title: Looking for Group

Final Project Fall 2016

Hey y'all. This is a pet project I've been working on for the last few weeks.

I'm a huge gamer, and sometimes I find it difficult to find people to play with, especially if you're trying something new. The
goal of LFG was to create a platform for gamers to connect on, and be more intentional with who they play with.  By allowing users
to add games to their profile with a skill level attached to each game, it gives an easy reference to people trying to find people to 
play with.  It also makes it easy for users to avoid people they may think don't fulfill their criteria for an ideal gaming partner/crew.

This is a huge work in progress, and there are still many features that I'd love to add, but all things start somewhere!

Feel free to leave any constructive criticism or feedback!
